**User**: "What services do you offer?"
**Bot**: "We offer four main services:
• 🏢 Smart Commercial Spaces with AI integration

## 🚀 To Enable Real AI (Optional)

1. Get a free Google Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_CHATBOT_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Restart the development server

## 🎨 Features Working

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If the chatbot isn't responding:
